# TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate whether a passenger survived or not based on various features. This serves as a classic example of binary classification in the field of data science
